\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
This paper will compare the time complexity of two color refinement algorithms and confirm them with computational results. The first algorithm, henceforth referred to as the basic algorithm, uses the color refinement algorithm as shown by J. de Jong\cite{presentation:slidesPartI}, while the other algorithm, henceforth referred to as the fast algorithm, is based on DFA minimization as shown by P. Bonsma\cite{presentation:slidesPartIII}. The algorithms have been implemented and their computation times on test sets will be used to confirm the time complexity.

Color refinement algorithms are used in solving the graph isomorphism problem, which is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic. It is one of a very small number of problems belonging to NP neither known to be solvable in polynomial time nor NP-complete: it is one of 12 such problems listed by Garey \& Johnson (1979)\cite{book:gareyJohnson1979}, and the only one of that list whose complexity remains unresolved.\cite{website:wikiGI}

%------------------------------------------------
\section{Scope \& Objectives}
\label{scope}
The aim of this research paper is to calculate and compare the worst-case time complexity of both color refinement algorithms and verifying them using computational results. These results will be used to examine the differences in the growth of the computation time for a specific type of graph.

This paper will describe both algorithms, give the calculations for the asymptotic worst-case time complexity, as well as an examination of the computational results.
%------------------------------------------------
\section{Methods}
\label{methods}
The time complexity of both algorithms was calculated by hand. To verify the results, a computational experiment was performed. In this experiment, both algorithms were tested with various sizes of a graph consisting of three paths. The paths are connected to each other on both of their ends. In the experiment the only thing changing is the length of these paths.

The testing was all done on the same machine, under the same circumstances. Every test was performed three times in order to prevent outliers caused by external events.

\subsection{Testing}
\label{methods:testing}
In the experiment, both algorithms were tested with several sizes of the same type of graph, as described above. Each algorithm was timed three times. The lowest value of the three was selected as the most accurate, as the error margin for timing algorithms on a system is one-sided: it can only go slower than its optimal value.

The python library used for timing the algorithm is \emph{timeit}. The manner in which it was used is the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
	min(Timer(algorithm_instance).repeat(3, 1))
\end{lstlisting}

Only the algorithms themselves and the initial coloring were timed, initialization and other parts of the code were not included.

%------------------------------------------------
\section{Algorithms}
\label{algs}
%% WIP %%
% Describe algorithms, show concise calculations of time complexity
%%
In the following subsections, we give a general overview of the algorithms and analyze them:
The computation time of a algorithms increases for iterations over the vertices in a graph. To calculate the worst-case time complexity of the algorithms, the number and places of the iterations over the vertices are analyzed.

The input and output for the algorithms are the same. The input is a graph with a possibly unstable  coloring. The output is graph with stable coloring. However, the graphs do have a different structure to support their respective algorithms refinement operation. 

A coloring $\alpha$ of a graph $G$ is called stable if for all $u, v \in V(G)$ it holds that: if $\alpha(u) = \alpha(v)$, then $u$ and $v$ have identically colored neighborhoods.
 

\subsection{Basic}
The basic algorithm gives all vertices in a graph with the same color but differently colored neighborhoods a separate color. This is done iteratively until the graph has a stable coloring. The problem with this method is that all vertices are checked each iteration. 

The basic implementation has several places where iterations over vertices take place. The code contains one main loop that has a worst-case of N iterations. Thereby the time complexity so far is $O(\boldsymbol{N})$, where $N = V(G)$. In this main loop an iteration takes place over all the vertices in the graph. The time complexity is now $O(N \cdot \boldsymbol{N})$. Each vertex is checked to see if it needs an update. If so, a new color dictionary is made and a new loop over the dictionary takes place. This makes the time complexity is $O(N \cdot N \cdot \boldsymbol{N})$ for making the dictionary and $O((N \cdot N)(N+\boldsymbol{N}))$ for iterating over the dictionary. Every color class in the dictionary is checked to see if the configuration has already been assigned a new color. If the the configuration is not yet know, a new color is assigned. In worst-case this new color operation costs N. The time complexity is $O((N \cdot N)(N+N+\boldsymbol{N}))$ so far.

After the first loop over the vertices in the main loop, the algorithm iterates over all the vertices to color all the vertices correctly in the main dictionary. The time complexity worst-case at the end is $O((N \cdot (N+\boldsymbol{N})(N+N+N)) = O(N^3)$.

\subsection{Fast}
With fast color refinement the colors that lead to refinements are tracked.(TODO: make better explanation) These colors are maintained in a queue. If a color class is being refined, the class is split into two different classes, with one class keeping the old color. The algorithm terminates with a stable coloring if no color class needs refinement, in other words the queue is empty.
